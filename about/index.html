<h1> About Me </h1>

<p>
I was born and raised in Honolulu, and am passionate about data science and analytics. It has been an unusual pathway to data science and analytics, but I have enjoyed every step of the way. 
</p>

<p>
Although I wasn't exceptionally great at math until high school, I always had fun with it and thought of math problems as a puzzle. Extremely persistent with a 'never give up' attitude, and a knack for learning from my mistakes, I actually developed a love for math, and it quickly became my favorite subject in school (along with Chinese). </p>

<p>
I initially went to the University of Southern California (USC) declared as an engineering major, because I heard that they use a lot of math. However, after fulfilling my calculus requirements, I lost interest in engineering, and decided that I loved the philosophy of occupational therapy (OT) and wanted to help others. Studying OT allowed me to learn about the healthcare system and analyze human anatomy and function. As an occupational therapist, I helped patients in hospitals, nursing rehabs, and pediatric clinics to achieve indepenedence in the things that were most important to them (self-care, cooking, socializing with friends, etc.). While the career was extremely rewarding, I found myself wondering about what I could have done if I had studied mathematics. </p>

During this time, I became deeply enamored with the ocean. I had always loved the ocean, but during this period of life, I spent almost every day in the ocean surfing, swimming, diving, or outrigger canoe paddling. I was never the most athletic person (the only sport I did in high school was bowling), but somehow made the paddling team to cross the Ka'iwi channel (from Moloka'i to O'ahu) in the Na Wahine race. This is one of my biggest personal accomplishments, because the Na Wahine race is an extremely prestigious outrigger canoe race. Never had I dreamed that I would race in the Na Wahine, but I did it... because I had an amazing team, and don't give up. </p>

I kept wondering about what would happen if I studied math 4 years after finishing college at USC, so I decided that I needed to go for it. I enrolled back into college at the University of Hawaii at Manoa (UHM) to pursue a second Bacehlor's in mathematics. Being back to school as a young adult was so awesome because I took advantage of every opportunity. I received scholarships and internships, and took classes in oceanography to learn about how math can be used in studying the ocean and sciences. Through the NOAA Hollings scholarship and internship, I was able to fulfill a dream of visiting the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument, part of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands, on a 26-day research expedition! </p>

The second Bachelor's naturally led to a Master's degree in oceanography at UHM, where I assisted with research in the Neuheimer Lab through biophysical modeling. During my graduate studies in oceanography, I discovered that I love to code. The bulk of my thesis involved creating an individual-based model in R of holoplanktonic copepods to see which biolgoical traits could help to explain the connectivity that was observed across the Atlantic Ocean basin. </p>

Currently, I have a small math tutoring company that I founded in 2017, and am enrolled in the Springboard Data Science Career track. When I was younger, I didn't know how to apply math to the real-world. However, I realize today that math is more than just solving puzzles, it helps us to understand the world we live in and is a way of thinking with logic. It has been really awesome to be applying logic through coding again and to be learning about Python and the various machine learning algorithms in data science. If there is one thing that I am sure of, it is that I am always going to be a student with the rate that technology is changing... and I absolutely love that, because it keeps life fascinating! </p>
